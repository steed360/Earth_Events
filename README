developed with python 2.7

Using the scripts
-----------------

1. Download all scripts into a directory that you create, say EONET_CODE
 
   You'll need rwx permissions

2. Get the pre-requisite packages if you don't have them already on python 2.7.
   I did this:

pip install virtualenv
virtualenv -v venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install openpyxl
